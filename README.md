## Features & Objectives

The purpose of this bot is to be the fastest in the 4B class. The original design featured extreme gear ratios for maximum speed, however, this was changed for a design with a two-gear transmisson. The two gear transmission allows for a gear for torque and acceleration, the other for pure speed. It will likely need to change in dimensions, so the current diagram is rough for a reason.
